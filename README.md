**Tech Stack**


This project is built using the following technologies:

HTML5: For structuring the content.


CSS3: For styling the website, with custom styles for modern UI elements.


JavaScript: For adding interactivity such as hover events, double-click play/pause, and dynamic responsive behavior.


AOS (Animate on Scroll): For smooth scroll animations.


Google Fonts: Using the "Playfair Display" font for a refined look.

**Usage**


Explore Playlist: Click the "Explore Playlist" button in the hero section to dive into the playlist of songs.


Play Songs: Hover over a song card to hear a preview of the track. You can also double-click on a card to toggle between play/pause.


Responsive Experience: The layout will automatically adjust based on the device screen size.


Mobile View: On mobile devices, the navbar will transform into a hamburger menu. Click the icon to access the navigation links.


**Responsiveness**


The website is fully responsive and optimized for the following screen sizes:

Desktop: The layout displays a grid-based playlist and sticky navbar.

Tablet: The playlist grid adjusts to fit the screen width, and the hamburger menu appears for navigation.

Mobile: The playlist items stack vertically, and the hamburger menu is visible at the top-right corner.


**Mobile Navigation**


On mobile devices, the navigation links are hidden by default and can be accessed by clicking the hamburger menu icon in the top-right corner.

This reveals the navigation links in a vertical column.

**CSS Media Queries**


Media queries are used to handle different screen sizes:

@media (max-width: 768px) for tablets and smaller screens.


@media (max-width: 480px) for mobile screens.


The layout adapts based on these queries, providing an optimized experience across devices.
